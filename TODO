every node opens socket.io connection on private port
	give a node in the cluster when start a node
		gets the rest of the nodes from that known node
	connect to all other nodes in the cluster
		send random integer id
		if node responds "duplicate," generate another one and send update to all nodes

use random integer id to decide who gets a token if there is contention
	smaller id wins
